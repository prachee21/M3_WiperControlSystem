Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. As  activating the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled, we are introducing an automatic wiper control system. Here  we have red , green, blue, and orange LED. The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 sec. On pressing of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8HZ . when wiper is ON: The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned above. The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.
